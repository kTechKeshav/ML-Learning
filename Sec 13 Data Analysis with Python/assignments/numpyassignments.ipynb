    "## Lesson: NumPy\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Array Creation and Manipulationâœ…\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (5, 5) filled with random integers between 1 and 20. Replace all the elements in the third column with 1.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (4, 4) with values from 1 to 16. Replace the diagonal elements with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Array Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (6, 6) with values from 1 to 36. Extract the sub-array consisting of the 3rd to 5th rows and 2nd to 4th columns.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (5, 5) with random integers. Extract the elements on the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Array Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two NumPy arrays of shape (3, 4) filled with random integers. Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (4, 4) with values from 1 to 16. Compute the row-wise and column-wise sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Statistical Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (5, 5) filled with random integers. Compute the mean, median, standard deviation, and variance of the array.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (3, 3) with values from 1 to 9. Normalize the array (i.e., scale the values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (3, 3) filled with random integers. Add a 1D array of shape (3,) to each row of the 2D array using broadcasting.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (4, 4) filled with random integers. Subtract a 1D array of shape (4,) from each column of the 2D array using broadcasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (3, 3) representing a matrix. Compute its determinant, inverse, and eigenvalues.\n",
    "2. Create two NumPy arrays of shape (2, 3) and (3, 2). Perform matrix multiplication on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 7: Advanced Array Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (3, 3) with values from 1 to 9. Reshape the array to shape (1, 9) and then to shape (9, 1).\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (5, 5) filled with random integers. Flatten the array and then reshape it back to (5, 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Fancy Indexing and Boolean Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (5, 5) filled with random integers. Use fancy indexing to extract the elements at the corners of the array.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (4, 4) filled with random integers. Use boolean indexing to set all elements greater than 10 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Structured Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a structured array with fields 'name' (string), 'age' (integer), and 'weight' (float). Add some data and sort the array by age.\n",
    "2. Create a structured array with fields 'x' and 'y' (both integers). Add some data and compute the Euclidean distance between each pair of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Masked Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a masked array of shape (4, 4) with random integers and mask the elements greater than 10. Compute the sum of the unmasked elements.\n",
    "2. Create a masked array of shape (3, 3) with random integers and mask the diagonal elements. Replace the masked elements with the mean of the unmasked elements."
